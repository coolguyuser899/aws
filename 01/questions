dynamodb concepts
table
item
attribute
partition or hash keys determines data distribution
highly distributed hash key design is important
hash range keys allows (composite primary key)
1:N relationship
enable righ query capabilities (all item, ==, <, >, begin with, between, count, top/bottom n values, paged response)
dynamodb schema is defined at attribute level, RDS defined at table level
gsi 1 table update = 0, 1, 2 gsi updates
0=item not in index before and after update
1=update introduces a new indexed-attribute, update deletes the indexed-attribute
2=updated changes the value of an indexed attribute from A to B
take advantage of sparse indexes (entry value is not contained in all items)
provision enough throughput for gsi, one update to table may result two writes to an index
ProvisionedThroughputExceededException (400) - consider increasing provisioning level for gsi with UpdateTable API
An dynamodb item maximum size is 400 KB.
eventual consistent read may return slightly stale data 
strongly consistent read returns most up to date data
dynamodb projects(copies) the specified attributes fromtableto the index.
global secondary index because query can span all data in a table, across all partitions
global table, replica table, one replica table per region,same name and primary key 
global table uses last writer win reconciliation 
create, update, delete, list table 
query : 
projection expression: subset of attributes must be returned
consistent read: specify strongly consistent read or eventually consistent read
filter expression: apply condition after read before returned to you
a query operation is more efficient than a sacn operation (scan expensive)
expression attribute name: start with #
expression attribute value: start with :
LastEvaluatedKey: when null no more result
ExclusiveStartKey: used from previous request 
GetItem 
PutItem
UpdateItem  (SET (add attributes), REMOVE, ADD (add an item), DELETE)
DeleteItem 
UpdateItem return values: NONE, ALL_OLD, UPDATE_OLD,ALL_NEW, UPDATED_NEW)
DeleteItem: return values to ALL_OLD
read-modify-write pattern, optimistic concurrency control: optimistic locking with version number only if item has not changed
BatchGetItem: up to 16MB, up to 100 items, from multiple tables
BatchWriteItem: up to 16 MB, 25 put or delete requests in multiple tables
DAX dynamodb compatible caching service benefit from fast im-memory performance 
dynamodb does not support cross item transactions
